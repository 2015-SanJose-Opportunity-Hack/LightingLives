# LightingLives
A visual platform to help a donor watch the connection they have with the child they're supporting. 
A lot of people who donate to Non Profits would like to see how they're affecting lives and in a way track their contributions to the community, and make a personal connection to whose lives they're affecting.

We're trying to provide a solution which does the above in the form of a lighting up sky.
